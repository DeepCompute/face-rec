# Face Detection and Recognition System

An end-to-end face detection and recognition system using the Viola/Jones
algorithm for detection and a version of Eigenfaces and k-nearest neighbors for
recognition.

Made as a final project for *EN.600.475: Introduction to Machine Learning* at
Johns Hopkins University.

Requires [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/), [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) (v2.4.11), and [pillow](http://python-pillow.github.io/).
